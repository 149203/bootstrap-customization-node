                  One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he
                  found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
                  He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a
                  little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and
                  divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly
                  able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His
                  many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest
                  of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened
                  to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper
                  human
